*Objective: Modeling user behaviors based on past user activities and generating accurate prediction of future user behaviors.*

*Expected Outcome: A classifier model mapping past user activities to possible future behavior.*

*Why: Predicting user behaviors has always been one of the trending topics. By predicting accurately, we can make recommendations more effective, improve user experience and thus increase our profits and popularity. Such researches are not just a double win between us and users. It's also a effective and practical way to develop and test data analytics/machine learning algorithms.*

**Dataset:** It is a data sample of user activities over several months from Yahoo! (https://webscope.sandbox.yahoo.com/catalog.php?datatype=a&did=78), which includes user interactions with pages, ads, and search results for a training period of 90 days and labels from a test period of 2 weeks. 

**Language:** Python, Hadoop, Spark, HBase, Scikit-learn, Tableau 

**Analytics:** Principle Component Analysis (PCA); 
Support Vector Machine (SVM); 
Multinomial Naive Bayes classification algorithm; 
Logistic Regression algorithm.
